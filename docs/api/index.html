    <h1>NrvrCommander API Index</h1>
    <p>This is a quick attempt at automatically producing <a href="nrvr.html">API documentation for NrvrCommander</a>
    from the <a href="https://github.com/srguiwiz/nrvr-commander">source code of NrvrCommander.</a></p>
    <p><a href="nrvr.html">Enjoy!</a></p>
    <p style="font-size: smaller">This page has been created manually, all others by a script using pydoc.
    Hence you could make this page more meaningful by editing it.
    E.g. a better index could be kept here.</p>
